# GameObjectRecorder-asAnimation

Using the Sample Code
Find the gameobject you want to record, and add the HierarchyRecorder component to it.

Create an empty animation clip for your gameobject.

Assign that new empty clip to the HierarchyRecorder’s “clip” field.

Start playing, and check the record box.

Move your objects around as desired (this can be done w/ physics, in the scene view, navigation, or other code).

Uncheck the record box.
